                <h2>Identifying Users</h2   >
                <p>I anticipate several types of users coming to my site.
                    First and foremost the site is a place for employers to
                    come and see my work. Secondly I expect my peers and
                    colleagues to view my site for inspiration or information.
                    Lastly my site will be a place for Online collaborators
                    to find content projects I have created for the design
                    community.</p>

                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>For the design I wanted to create something that was simple, responsive, and focused on the content. To achieve this I chose to work mostly with black, white, and a blue accent color, making sure to leave lots of whitespace. I made use of large changing images for headers to draw interest in projects quickly</p>

                <h2>Sources Technology</h2>
                <p>One of the key technologies I used throughout the site was jQuery. I used jQuery to handle most of the interactive enhancements to the site such as having the nav bar change when you scroll or having a button appear at the bottom of the viewport that returns the user to the top of the page</p>
                <p>Another Technology I used was webp images. This tech is a new image file format by google that is signifigantly smaller than jpgs but look better. Unfortunatily this technology is not fully supported across all common browsers so I needed to use source set and the JS library Modernize to serve jpgs as fallbacks.</p>

                <h2>Changes From Original</h2>
                <p>The difference between this project and project 2 are that I have rebuilt the site using grid and flexbox to make everything scale more smoothly too mobile. In addition I am now using JS and jQuery to add interactive elemts to the project that enhance the user experiance. I have also begun to consider how I serve optomized responsive images using webp and Modernizer. My new solution is more robust and usable and is handled better by different browsers and viewport sizes.</p>
